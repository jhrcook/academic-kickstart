I am a computational biologist pursuing a PhD. in computational biology at Harvard Medical School.
My primary interest is in understanding the tissue-specific behaviors of oncogenes in cancers.

In my free time, I enjoy learning about programming and computer science - my current project is working on [comparing AI/ML summarization methods on scientific publications](https://github.com/jhrcook/sci-article-summarization).
Off the computer, my hobbies include running, exercising, caring for my plants, and baking bread.
