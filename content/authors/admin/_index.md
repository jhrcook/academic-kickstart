Josh is a computational biologist pursuing his PhD. at Harvard Medical School. There, he is co-advised by Professor Kevin Haigis and Professor Peter Park as he studies cancer genetics and evolution. Specifically, he is working to understand the tissue-specific behavior of *KRAS* mutations in cancers.

In his free time, Josh enjoys learning about programming and computer science - his current project is creating a MacOS app to summarize text using machine learning. Off the computer, his hobbies include running and caring for his plants.
