I am a computational biologist at [Vertex Pharmaceuticals](https://www.vrtx.com/) in Boston, MA.

In my free time, I enjoy learning about programming and computer science - my current project is [learning the basics of causal inference](https://github.com/jhrcook/the-effect-notes).
Off the computer, my hobbies include running üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, exercising üèãüèª, caring for my plants üåµ, and baking bread üçû.
