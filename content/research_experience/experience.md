**Investigating the mutational relationships in colorectal cancer**
With Dr. Giorgio Melloni in the Park Lab, I am working to understand why some mutations co-occur at a frequency above that expected by chance alone using a pathway-level approach.

**Tissue specificity of *KRAS* mutations**
In collaboration with the Gygi (Dept. of Cell Bio., HMS) and Lauffenburger (MIT) Labs, we are searching for the reasons underpinning the results of *KRAS* mutations in different tissues. The question we are asking is, “Why are some *KRAS* mutations only oncogenic in a subset of tissues?” with the desire to better understand the mechanisms by which *KRAS* mutations induce oncogenesis.
