abstract: "The motility of blood monocytes is orchestrated by the activity of cell-surface integrins, which translate extracellular signals into cytoskeletal changes to mediate adhesion and migration. *Toxoplasma gondii* is an intracellular parasite that infects migratory cells and enhances their motility, but the mechanisms underlying *T. gondii* –induced hypermotility are incompletely understood. We investigated the molecular basis for the hypermotility of primary human peripheral blood monocytes and THP-1 cells infected with *T. gondii*. Compared with uninfected monocytes, *T. gondii* infection of monocytes reduced cell spreading and the number of activated $\\beta1$ integrin clusters in contact with fibronectin during settling, an effect not observed in monocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or *Escherichia coli*. Furthermore, *T. gondii* infection disrupted the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at tyrosine 397 (Tyr- 397) and Tyr-925 and of the related protein proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) at Tyr-402. The localization of paxillin, FAK, and vinculin to focal adhesions and the colocalization of these proteins with activated $\\beta1$ integrins were also impaired in *T. gondii* –infected monocytes. Using time-lapse confocal microscopy of THP-1 cells expressing enhanced GFP (eGFP)-FAK during settling on fibronectin, we found that *T. gondii* -induced monocyte hypermotility was characterized by a reduced number of enhanced GFP-FAK–containing clusters over time compared with uninfected cells. This study demonstrates an integrin conformation–independent regulation of the $\\beta1$ integrin adhesion pathway, providing further insight into the molecular mechanism of *T. gondii*–induced monocyte hypermotility."
