abstract: "*KRAS* is the most frequently mutated oncogene. The incidence of specific *KRAS* alleles varies between cancers from different sites, but it is unclear whether allelic selection results from biological selection for specific mutant KRAS proteins. We used a cross- disciplinary approach to compare KRAS<sup>G12D</sup>, a common mutant form, and KRAS<sup>A146T</sup>, a mutant that occurs only in selected cancers. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that KRAS<sup>A146T</sup> exhibits a marked extension of switch 1 away from the protein body and nucleotide binding site, which activates KRAS by promoting a high rate of intrinsic and guanine nucleotide exchange factorâ€“induced nucleotide exchange. Using mice genetically engineered to express either allele, we found that KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> and KRAS<sup>A146T</sup> exhibit distinct tissue-specific effects on homeostasis that mirror mutational frequencies in human cancers. These tissue-specific phenotypes result from allele-specific signaling properties, demonstrating that context-dependent variations in signaling downstream of different KRAS mutants drive the *KRAS* mutational pattern seen in cancer."
