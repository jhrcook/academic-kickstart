  abstract = "Missense mutations at the three hotspots in the guanosine
              triphosphatase (GTPase) RAS-Gly12, Gly13, and Gln61 (commonly
              known as G12, G13, and Q61, respectively)-occur differentially
              among the three RAS isoforms. Q61 mutations in KRAS are
              infrequent and differ markedly in occurrence. Q61H is the
              predominant mutant (at 57\%), followed by Q61R/L/K (collectively
              40\%), and Q61P and Q61E are the rarest (2 and 1\%,
              respectively). Probability analysis suggested that mutational
              susceptibility to different DNA base changes cannot account for
              this distribution. Therefore, we investigated whether these
              frequencies might be explained by differences in the biochemical,
              structural, and biological properties of KRASQ61 mutants.
              Expression of KRASQ61 mutants in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and RIE-1
              epithelial cells caused various alterations in morphology, growth
              transformation, effector signaling, and metabolism. The
              relatively rare KRASQ61E mutant stimulated actin stress fiber
              formation, a phenotype distinct from that of KRASQ61H/R/L/P,
              which disrupted actin cytoskeletal organization. The crystal
              structure of KRASQ61E was unexpectedly similar to that of
              wild-type KRAS, a potential basis for its weak oncogenicity.
              KRASQ61H/L/R-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell
              lines exhibited KRAS-dependent growth and, as observed with
              KRASG12-mutant PDAC, were susceptible to concurrent inhibition of
              ERK-MAPK signaling and of autophagy. Our results uncover
              phenotypic heterogeneity among KRASQ61 mutants and support the
              potential utility of therapeutic strategies that target KRASQ61
              mutant-specific signaling and cellular output.",
