Here, I demonstrate how to find the point where two histograms overlap. While this is an approximation, it seems to have a very high level of precision. 

### Prepare simulated data

I created two data sets, `gamma_dist` and `norm_dist`, which are made up of a different number of values sampled randomly from a gamma distribution and normal distribution, respectively. I specicially made the data sets different sizes to make the point that this method is still applicable.

```r
library(tibble)

set.seed(0)

gamma_dist <- rgamma(1e5, shape = 2, scale = 2)
norm_dist <- rnorm(5e5, mean = 20, sd = 5)

df <- tibble(
  x = c(gamma_dist, norm_dist),
	original_dataset = c(rep("gamma_dist", 1e5), rep("norm_dist", 5e5))
)
df
#> # A tibble: 600,000 x 2
#>        x original_dataset
#>    <dbl> <chr>
#>  1  6.89 gamma_dist
#>  2  2.25 gamma_dist
#>  3  1.30 gamma_dist
#>  4  4.10 gamma_dist
#>  5  7.77 gamma_dist
#>  6  5.08 gamma_dist
#>  7  4.58 gamma_dist
#>  8  2.30 gamma_dist
#>  9  1.36 gamma_dist
#> 10  1.67 gamma_dist
#> # â€¦ with 599,990 more rows
```
I used 'ggplot2' to plot the densities of the two data sets. The gamma distribution is in red and the normal distribution is in blue. I broke the creation of the plot into two steps: the essential step to create the density curves, and the styling step to make the plot look nice. Of course, these could be combined into a single long ggplot statement.

```r
library(ggplot2)

p <- ggplot(df) +
  geom_density(aes(x = x, color = original_dataset))

p <- p +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expand_scale(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("tomato", "dodgerblue")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
      legend.title = element_blank(),
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  ) +
  labs(x = "values",
       title = "Two density curves")
```

### Finding the point of intersection

To find the point of intersection, I first binned the data sets using `density`. It is essential to use the same `from` and `to` values for each data set. The `density` function creates 512 bins, thus, providing the same starting and ending parameters makes `density` use the same bins for each data set.

```r
from <- 0
to <- 40
gamma_density <- density(gamma_dist, from = from, to = to)
norm_density <- density(norm_dist, from = from, to = to)
```
The final step was to find where the density of the gamma distribution was less than the normal distribution. Therefore, I applied this logic to create the boolean vector `idx`. I also included two other filters to contain the result between 5 to 20 because, from the plot above, I can see that the intersection falls within this range.

```r
idx <- (gamma_density$y < norm_density$y) &
       (gamma_density$x > 5) &
       (gamma_density$x < 20)
poi <- min(gamma_density$x[idx])
poi
#> 10.64579
```
That's it, the point of intersection has been approximated to a high precision. A vertical line was added to the plot below at `poi`.

```r
p <- p + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = poi, linetype = 2, size = 0.3, color = "black") +
  annotate(geom = "text", label = round(poi, 3),
           x = poi - 1, y = 0.1, size = 4, angle = 90)
```
