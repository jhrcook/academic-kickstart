Here, I am documenting my attempt to grow *Lithops* from seed. So far, I have built LED lights and sowed some seeds. Plenty have germinated and, recently, undergone their first split to reveal their first set of true leaves.

## Varieties

* [*Lithops julii ssp. julii C064*](http://www.lithops.info/en/gallery/lithops_c64.html)
* [*Lithops julii ssp. fulleri v. fulleri* C161](http://www.lithops.info/en/gallery/lithops_c161.html)
* [*Lithops hallii v. hallii* C158](http://www.lithops.info/en/gallery/lithops_c158.html)
* [*Lithops karasmontana ssp. karasmontana v. karasmontana* (syn. mickbergensis) C168](http://www.lithops.info/en/gallery/lithops_c168.html)
* [*Lithops karasmontana ssp. karasmontana v. tischeri* C182](http://www.lithops.info/en/gallery/lithops_c182.html)

## Progress Posts

### Seeds have been Sown

**March 9, 2019**

I have sown 3 varieties of *Lithops* in one 10 cm round pot. I used a soil of 3 parts perlite, 3 parts sand, and 1 part sifted potting soil. Importantly, I included a paper towel at the bottom to prevent soil from falling through and creating craters in the soil. I sowed the following:

* [36 x *Lithops julii ssp. julii* C064](http://www.lithops.info/en/gallery/lithops_c64.html)
* [36 x *Lithops karasmontana ssp. karasmontana v. karasmontana* (syn. mickbergensis) C168](http://www.lithops.info/en/gallery/lithops_c168.html)
* [54 x *Lithops hallii v. hallii* C158](http://www.lithops.info/en/gallery/lithops_c158.html)

I placed the pot into a clean yogurt tub with water to keep the soil moist until germination. I also put the lid on with small ventilation holes to keep the environment humid. Now, I need to keep an eye on the water level, daily.

### Germination!

**March 13, 2019**

The first few seeds have germinated! I have not had to touch the seeds at all since sowing them except for checking that there is plenty of water in the reservoir. This has remained at a good height, so these have been really low maintenance thus far — I’m preparing for that the change, soon.

### A few more sprouts

**March 14, 2019**

More seeds sprouted today and some are starting to take shape. I have removed the lid of the yogurt container to reduce the humidity, but left the pot in water so the soil stays moist. I also added a paper towel across the top of the container to filter the light while the plants are still young.

A few of the plants fell over because they were not covered by a thin layer of sand. I tried to cover everything, the problem is that while I was laying the top layer of sand, I could not seed where I had already covered. Next time, I will put the pot in water, let the water soak to the top, and then add sand. That way, I will be able to see the difference in color between the wet and dry sand to ensure good coverage.

### They’re still alive

**March 16, 2019**

The *Lithops* seedlings are still growing. I have removed them from constant water supply and will instead track the moisture of the soil, periodically placing them in water to soak the soil. Ideally, I want the soil to be constantly moist, but not soaking.

In other news, my *Echuveria purpusorum* is sending up a stalk and the *Haworthia* is still flowering.

### Update on Growth

**March 23, 2019**

I have watered the lithos by dipping them in water earlier this week. Many are still alive, though I think there has been a bit of die back. They have grown well, especially the *julli*!

### Sown *Lithops julii ssp. fulleri* C161

**March 24, 2019**

I planted 22 seeds of *Lithops julii ssp. fulleri* C161 on March 24, 2019. I used the same soil mixture as in the previous batch. This time, though, I sterilized the soil mixture by microwaving the soil for 2.5 minutes (I let the soil cool off before using). I have noticed some [“damping off”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping_off) has killed quite a few of the seedlings in my first batch; the main sign is a that they will have a very thin stem and eventually fall over. Hopefully, this trick that I have seen some other use will mitigate any infection. Also, this time I compacted the soil a little bit before sowing the seeds. I don’t know how much this will help, though it was recommended in the main reference I am using.


### Lithops julii ssp. fulleri C161 have sprouted

**March 29, 2019**

The seeds have sprouted! I think I have counted 19 out of 22 seeds, so pretty good germination rate. I will take them out of water in the next couple of days

### New soil mixture for sowing Lithops karasmontana C168

**March 30, 2019**

I have finally purchased some aragonite, a component of my soil that has been missing, thus far. I just bought some being sold as aquarium sand from PetCo. To try it out, I made a soil mixture of 1/2 aragonite, 1/4 sand, and 1/4 sifted potting soil, then added a small handful of perlite. I planted 26 seeds, but did a poor job of dispersing them as many slid out at the same time.

Also, I have noticed that the water wicking properties of this mixture are much weaker than my other mixture, likely due to the reduced amount of sand. Hopefully it is strong enough, but I will have to keep an eye on it. The seeds are now sitting in water that is just below the top line of the soil to ensure water reaches the top.


### (About) one-month later…

**April 6, 2019**

It has been just under one month, so I though I should share some update photos of the three varieties a first planted. They are generally growing well, though are already taking on slight different morphologies. There was one round of die-off, and I foresee another one as some are much too close together. However, many still look healthy and I remain hopeful that they will continue to grow.

### Still Growing Strong!

**April 20, 2019**

This is just a quick update on the growth of all three containers. The large contiainer (left image below) I planted first is growing very well and the little butts are getting nice and plump. The *Lithops julli ssp. fulleri* C161 (middle image below) are not doing well, likely because I under-watered early on. Finally, the newest seedlings, Lithops karasmontana C168 (right image below), are doing well. You can see the clumps where multiple seeds fell in while I was sowing.

### Changing Colors

**May 15, 2019**

Since the flower stalk for my *Echeveria* and *Haworthia* has died off, I could again lower the lighting fixture to provide more light to my plants - other plants were stretching, too, so this helped out more than just this *Lithops*. The increased light intensity and maturity of the seedlings (the oldest are over two months!) has caused some of them to take a darker green/brown color.

The seedlings in the most recent potting, the one with the white large-grain sand covering, are doing very well! The tops of the Lithops are right at the line of the top covering. I think this is helping them stand up and also reduce the amount of light reaching the wet top layer of soil, reducing algae growth. I think I will continue with this method for future pots.
