## Introduction

This project is the documentation of my second attempt at growing *Lithops* from seed.
My [first attempt]({{<ref "project/Lithops-from-seed">}}) went well and has just, at the time of writing, reached the 1 year mark with a dozen or so survivors.
My approach to this hobby has always been as a fun and experimental project.
As such, I am not expecting much success, but instead to learn about the plants and improve over time.

### The plants

This time around, I have sown the following plants, all purchased from [Mesa Gardens](https://mesagarden.com):

- [Lithops villetii ssp. deboeri (C230A)](https://mesagarden.com/product/lithops-villetii-1767) (20-30 seeds)
- [Lithops dorotheae (C124)](https://mesagarden.com/product/lithops-dorotheae-1571) (20-30 seeds)
- [Lithops lesliei ssp. lesliei var. rubrobrunnea (C17)](https://mesagarden.com/product/lithops-lesliei-1651-5) (10 seeds)
- [Lithops verruculosa (1757.2) - "Rose of Texas"](https://mesagarden.com/product/lithops-verruculosa-1757-2) (20-30 seeds)

Most of the provided links have images included with the plant information (the owners of Mesa Gardens are still working on adding pictures to the new site, so some may not have any photos).

I have provided some background information on *Lithops* and their care in a blog post: [Lithops]({{<ref "post/lithops-background">}}).

#### 2020-02-16 - Seeds have been sown

I sowed the seeds.
I used the following soil mixture:

- 2 parts [Espoma Organic Perlite](https://www.amazon.com/Espoma-PR8-8-Quart-Organic-Perlite/dp/B002Y0AK6S/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=espoma+perlite&qid=1581897997&s=lawn-garden&sr=1-1)
- 1 part [Espoma Organic Cactus Mix](https://www.amazon.com/Espoma-CA8-4-8QT-Cactus-Pot/dp/B07JYRV59V/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=espoma+cactus&qid=1581897976&s=lawn-garden&sr=1-3)
- 1 part [Hoffman Western Desert Sand](https://www.amazon.com/Hoffman-14302-Western-Desert-Quarts/dp/B000RNH2U6)

I think it would be preferrable to use decomposed granite or pool filter sand, but I could not find a non-industrial size bag of either.

I did not sterlize the soil with a microwave or oven because I doubt my roommate would appreciate that.
However, if possible, this is generally a recommended way of sterlizing the soil before sowing.

I sowed all of the seeds that came in the packets.

I first packed the soil into 2x2 4-inch tall plastic pots and then watered the soil thoroughly.
This ompacted the soil, so I added more to the top to fill in the difference.
The seeds were dispersed over the top; I use a small piece of paper folded in the middle to funnel the seeds mixed with some sand across the surface.
I then left the pots in tubs with water and a lid.
They will remain there until there is sufficient germination.

#### 2020-02-20 - First germination

The *Lithops verruculosa* are the first to germinate!
I will keep them in the water for another few days, and then reduce the amount of water in the container to maintain humidity but reduce overall water supply.
From there, for the next few weeks I will water them from the bottom daily.
