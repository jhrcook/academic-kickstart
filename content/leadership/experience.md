I am a general tutor for a high school freshman. Therefore, in any one night, we will range from history to physics to computer science. Mainly, I ensure that he understands the material and help him grasp topics he finds difficult. While I have a good handle on most of the information covered, sometimes his course material stretches well beyond my comfort level (for example, his Mandarin course). When I find myself in these scenarios, I probe his understanding by asking questions and having him teach me the material.
