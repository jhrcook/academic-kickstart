I created my website using [Academic Kickstart](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) and Hugo. It is hosted on Netlify at [https://joshuacook.netlify.com](https://joshuacook.netlify.com).

### [Academic Kickstart](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/)

**Academic** makes it easy to create a beautiful website for free using Markdown, Jupyter, or RStudio. Customize anything on your site with widgets, themes, and language packs. [Check out the latest demo](https://academic-demo.netlify.com/) of what you'll get in less than 10 minutes, or [view the showcase](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/#expo).
